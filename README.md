## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS 

### What I learned

While I was working on this project, I learned how to use SCSS and it really speed up the process in my stylesheet. 

### Challenges

One thing that I found challenging while working on this project is the nutritional facts chart. I had a difficult time formatting the table like that of the original design. I thought by add horizontal lines, it would achieve what I was looking for... but it didn't. Until, I found out about the ```:not``` and ```:last-of-type``` psuedo classes from **mdn web docs_**

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This online resources explains both the ```:not``` and ```:last-of-type``` psuedo classes.
